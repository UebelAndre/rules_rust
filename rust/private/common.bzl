"""A resilient API layer wrapping compilation and other logic for Rust rules.

This module is meant to be used by custom rules that need to compile Rust code
and cannot simply rely on writing a macro that wraps `rust_library`. This module
provides the lower-level interface to Rust providers, actions, and functions.
Do not load this file directly; instead, load the top-level `rust.bzl` file,
which exports the `rust_common` struct.

In the Bazel lingo, `rust_common` gives the access to the Rust Sandwich API.
